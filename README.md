# 3DC IAP Conference (Working Title)
**Decentralised planning for the IAP Month**

Do let us know if you can think of a better name for this event! That's why it's still a working title.

## What is this?
3DC IAP Conference is a collation of related activities for  to the SUTD community. It will last from 06 January - 17 January 2019.

It is currently a working title because the name is still in the midst of being decided. Afterall, it’s a 3 week event and no longer just one week!

3DC IAP Conference is organised by 3DC, supported by OpenSUTD.

## Current State
All IAPS are currently conducted individually by seperate parties, which are usually a series of talks/activities/workshops that encourage students to pursue their interests. 

Issues:
* The IAPS may come in odd fashion with beginner events amongst the tougher events.
* Timings may clash which disallows students from successively attending multiple IAPs.
* IAP materials are sometimes not shared to the participants.

## Concept(Subject to Changes)
Adopting the model of a Conference with large-scale talks targeted at the general audience but also breakout sessions that participants can sign-up for on an individualised manner.
*This emphasizes on personal agency to allow for self-discovery of SUTD’s ecosystem*

## What's in it for me?
* There will be less admin workload as you will just need to provide us the information.
* All resources regarding each activity will be uploaded/referenced here
* Bigger IAP event will also have more influence able to draw bigger names in to speak or organise an activity together.
* Possibly better attendance because when placed as a package, the overall value of going for IAPs will increase.

## Core Vision
We intend to bring relevant IAPs together offered under conference style with the aim to widen the learning horizon and deepen the subject knowledge of the SUTD community by complementing the experiential learning component of a student’s experience.
We foresee that such an event will aid students to participate in meaningful exchange of rich ideas through diversified experiences and engagement in advanced technologies. 

We also hope that such an event with shared resources will lead to repeats of such an event for subsequent batches.

## References
Referencing to the [discoverSUTD](https://github.com/OpenSUTD/discovery-week-working-title) documentation, we will be able to have a centralised hub for sign ups as well as streamlining feedback and organisation operations as well as a IAP calendar which will allow students to plan out their activities for the period. We plan to document the entire process so that planning and resources can be referred to or reused so that this GIANT IAP will become easily repeatable for the next batch iof students

## Contributing
In general the workflow is:
1. Submit a proposal through Github Issues on our master repository
2. We will reply to your issue and review it.
3. Once it is reviewed and cleared, you will get a notification.
4. If you’re proposing a session for the event, please proceed to Eventyay to submit your proposal. This is done to collate your details and to get ready to schedule you for the event. Otherwise, if you’re making a suggestion for improvement, the workflow will diverge and tailor to the idea given.


## Timeline
This is to cater to Fifth row leaders or individuals when they are planning. The detailed proposal is [here]

## Things to do
*Get people to submit their IAPs as Issues.
