**Decentralised planning for the IAP Month**

Check out the [posts] for meeting notes

Do let us know if you can think of a better name for this event! That's why it's still a working title.

## What is this?
3DC IAP Conference is a collation of related activities for  to the SUTD community. It will last from 06 January - 17 January 2019.

It is currently a working title because the name is still in the midst of being decided. Afterall, it’s a 3 week event and no longer just one week!

Discovery Week is organised by 3DC, supported by OpenSUTD.

## Concept
Adopting the model of a Conference with large-scale talks targeted at the general audience but also breakout sessions that participants can sign-up for on an individualised manner.
*This emphasizes on personal agency to allow for self-discovery of SUTD’s ecosystem*

## Core Vision
We intend to bring relevant IAPs together offered under conference style with the aim to widen the learning horizon and deepen the subject knowledge of the SUTD community by complementing the experiential learning component of a student’s experience.
We foresee that such an event will aid students to participate in meaningful exchange of rich ideas through diversified experiences and engagement in advanced technologies. 

## References
Referencing to the [discoverSUTD](https://github.com/OpenSUTD/discovery-week-working-title) documentation, we will be able to have a centralised hub for sign ups as well as streamlining feedback and organisation operations as well as a IAP calendar which will allow students to plan out their activities for the period. We plan to document the entire process so that planning and resources can be referred to or reused so that this GIANT IAP will become easily repeatable for the next batch iof students
