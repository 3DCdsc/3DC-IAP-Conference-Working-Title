# Concept
Using a conference-like model with larger-scale activities and talks to  with rising industries,
it allows the individual  to be well positioned for students to scale their knowledge throughout the IAP period

This is with **emphasis on personal agency** to allow for self-discovery and pursuit of knowledge towards rising/popular industries.

## Objectives
1. Students - cultivating the desired culture through providing multiple avenues for resources and communities to impact

**Culture embodying the spirit of innovation, collaboration, having self-initiated projects, self-directed learning and broad-based skill integration**

2. SUTD - to expand the experiences provided by the school in this period that students can look forward to take advantage of
